                <h2>Interactive Media</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>I have a strong interest in interactive media. In recent weeks, I've delved into various techniques such as user scenarios, empathy mapping, interviews, observations, competitor analysis, user journeys, and prototyping, among others. You can find all my assignments documented <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eyt1kmvrCdyWiLq91kZOG66jizGtCOKr/edit">HERE</a>. These diverse techniques have been instrumental in developing my portfolio.

                    To create it, I started by examining portfolios of frontend programmers. After crafting the prototype, I began working on the portfolio itself. Once completed, I conducted two user tests to observe how my friends navigated through it. In applying these techniques to our group project, we conducted interviews and crafted a survey, from which we developed personas.

                <h2>Design</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>The design of my portfolio, along with my logo and the client site, has undergone several iterations. The prototype of the site will be included in the portfolio submission. Regarding my logo, I utilized Photoshop to create the figure and bring everything together. While we had to work with Adobe Illustrator, I'm not yet good enough with it, so I decided to go with Photoshop. The chosen slogan, although somewhat clich√©, aligns well with my way of work (and it is the slogan of one of my favorite basketball teams).

                    As for the client site, we used an AI to quickly develop it; you can view it <a href="https://anne4951.hocoos.com">HERE</a>. However, we still need to conduct interviews to finalize the concept. Additionally, we plan to adjust the color scheme to better represent our client's preferences.

                    Over the recent weeks, I've undergone significant improvement in my perspective. We began by delving into semantics (check the documntation on it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17KJQNU4udWdpwx3fcNXjWWdLDEVrYxO5_jSKk5fmKBA/edit">HERE</a>)  and our initial project involved reconstructing
                    the <a href="https://ssceindhoven.tue.nl">SSCE</a> website  While I encountered challenges, such as image formatting and creating the overlay banner with membership options, I successfully addressed them by employing z-index and absolute positioning. <br/>
                    Our subsequent assignment involved creating a responsive design without relying on media queries, instead utilizing positioning, grids, and max/min height/width. 
                    This proved to be considerably more challenging, requiring extensive adjustments to the entire layout. I must acknowledge that it became somewhat difficult to complete within the given deadline. Unfortunately, due to issues with Filezilla, I cant upload it directly. So, I'll be including the zipped file in the portfolio submission, 
                    along with all the other assignments. <br/> 
                    The final task was recreating a website of our choice from the nominees of the week; you can refer to the original for comparison. <a href="https://www.rizontruck.com">HERE</a> and my version will be posted in the portfolio submission.
                    the biggest problems i faced were making it responsive which i still havent been able to do, but i want to finish it by the end of the vacation.<br/>
                    Part of the last assignment was setting up a github which i had some problems with but with the help of Wit i managed to do it, the link for it is <a href="https://github.com/Kambo22?tab=repositories">HERE</a><br/>
                    When it comes to my portfolio i spent most of the time working on it making it as responsive as i could although i wanned to devide every single outcome on a different page due to not having enough time i ended up creating
                    3 categories. The goal for next week would be to change that and also add pictures on the pages with all of the project i have completed for the specific asighnment.
