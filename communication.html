                      <p>In order to deliver the best possible product for our client we know that communication is key and in order to deliver a product that would fit the need of athina we conducted a few interviews. From those interviews we got some interesting takeaways. All of the answers you can see below</p>

                        The second time we reached out to her we wanted to get her input when it comes to the survey answers we got. During this it became obvious that the cli-ent and her users wanted a mobile version of the website as well. And when we mentioned this to our teacher(josh) he asked us a question that we never though of and it was which version are we going to prioritise so in order to answer this we gathered as a group and decided that the best course of action would be to start with the desktop version and to make it responsive on mobile. we sadly dont have the answwers to the interview since the client deleted her email with the answers so we have the summerised version in the presentation.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        During our last presentation we found out we were missing important input such as asking our client more in depth when it comes to her functional require-ments. This problem we have fixed and are going to present on the 28th of November. The presentation you can check here:

                      <p>
                        When it comes to upkeep we as a group decided that it would be best to create a seperate document which contains steps on how to add new content to the website, but since i thought that would be a bit confusing i propossed a video on the porcess to be made.The video you can see on the left and the documentation of the porcess below.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        This tutorial is designed specifically for our client, providing both a written guide and a video tutorial on how to navigate and customize the website. The tutorial is structured into two main sections. The first section covers setting up the website, incorporating images, and establishing links. The second section provides a step-by-step guide on adding an information/image slider page to the gallery pictures.

                        <p>
                          Crafting a user-friendly guide for our client is a crucial aspect of website development. Our team collaborated to ensure the client can easily comprehend and utilize all the website features, especially when adding new content. Personally, working on a team to create this manual posed some challenges as it was my first experience in such a task. Nevertheless, I take pride in the successful completion of the manual, offering comprehensive guidance to our client.

                    <p>In conclusion, the importance of thoughtful interaction in our group project cannot be overstated. To make our project a success it is important to stay in contact with the client and our users. In essence, staying engaged is the cornerstone of a successful and collaborative project.</p>

                      <p>Having great communication with the group is really important and although we started of a bit rocky when it comes to communicating since we had a lot of personal problems such as 4 of us not having found a place to stay yet. With time this problem disappeared and we have established really good communication.

                  <h5 class="subheading">how we do it</h5>
                      <p>The communication is mainly done on whatsapp where we use it for deviding the work and checking up on the progress of each member. We use discord for our files basically having it be a repository. When it comes to leader-ship we haven’t appointed a leader but me and thijs are usually the ones respon-sible for the devision of the work.
                      </p>
                    <h5 class="subheading">Problems Faced</h5>
                    <p>
                      For me making the mistake of not having a leader of the group and putting everyone on the same level has proven to be quite inefficent. Sadly this problem was present all the way until the last 3 or 4 weeks of the semester which slowed our work by alot another problem we faced was people not really coming. But with me and thijs taking charge of the group and being alot more strict when it comes to deadlines i think we managed to pull off a really nice project at the end.

                      <p>In conclusion, I saw how important leaders are for the efficent work of a team and in the futere i wont let this mistake of not having a leader appointed happen again.</p>

                      <p>Finding the perfect target group for this project was a bit of a problem since athina wants a website that combines both her art and her research so we dis-cussed among ourselves and decided that the target audience are art students and professors  later on we had some help from Josh and he helped us with our deci-sion to stick to artists.</p>
                      <p>In order to make the site the best it can be we sent our surveys to art students we knew and since we lacked responses we decided to create a second one which I sent to friends in Graphic design in Bulgaria and ask for their input as well and this time around we had a way better base line for what the users want and need.

                      <p>When it comes to communicating with my teachers i think i am doing really well. I have always valued communication when it comes to improvement and getting feedback from them is crucial to achieving my goal of reaching beggining on my second portfolio submission. After i had my grading on my first portfolio i gathered alot of information on what is required and i think i delivered this time around.

                        For this we had to create a pitch in order to inform and win over our client. To assure the success of this i devided the work between each group member:

                      <p>
                        Now, after watching the entire video, let's review the steps taken to achieve our project goals. As I mentioned earlier, everyone in the team had a specific role, and on the left side, you can see the script that I created. Reflecting on how this experience has benefited me and our group, several advantages stand out.

                        Firstly, each member's assigned role brought us closer as a team, significantly enhancing our overall productivity. This strengthened team cohesion played a pivotal role in our success. Secondly, having a clear script allowed our client, Athina, to connect a face with the individuals crafting the project for her. This personal connection heightened trust and belief in our team's capabilities.
                        
                        Furthermore, taking on a leadership role provided me with valuable insights. It demonstrated how a designated leader can significantly boost the group's efficiency. Additionally, I discovered new skills within our team, particularly in Yoshua, who showcased proficiency in editing and camera work. These newfound skills added depth and versatility to our collaborative efforts.

                    <p>
                      In conclusion This project was great for our bond as a team since during the filming there was no shortage mess ups and fun moments and i can proudly was it was the start of a greatly inproved workflow as a result of the trust between us increasing.

                      <p>During the third week we had a chance to present our first progress check with the use of a presentation. In order to give the stakeholders (Our teachers) the best overview of all of the works we had done my group and i went over the interviews which we had at the start with our client which due to her deleting the docs and us making the mistake of not downloading we dont have, but the most important points were: Creating a color scheme with vivid colors and what was the main purpose of the website and that being for her to show off her research and gather traction to her website.</p>

                    <figcaption class="textboxx">
                      <p>And even though it went well overall we still needed some points of improvement from what i remember that was to pin point exactly who the users are and get them involved more since we lacked responses on our surveys. This is also pointed out in the feedpulse checkpoint on the right </p>

                    <p>
                      In summary, even though things went smoothly, we made a mistake in understanding who the users truly are. In my opinion, we didn't gather enough information about our client, leading us to focus more on her artistic career than the research aspect. I've learned that overlooking details like not gathering sufficient information about future clients is a really big issue and i wont repeat this mistake again.

                      <p>Sadly the second presentation went alot worse with us missing out alot of research information since we only had 6 survey answers and us lacking proper requirements. This acted as a wake up call for our group which in turn led to making the decition of starting over with our surveys and we created a new survey which we did alot better on gathering 30 answers. Both surveys are below and you can read more information on my reearch page.</p>

                      <p>When it comes to the requirements we took another look over the interviews which we had with our client and I was responsible for rewriting the requirements for the next presentation. On the right you can see The feedpulse we got which outlines the issues i mentioned previously.</p>

                      In conclution this showed once again some cracks when it comes to understanding fully the requirements and it once again served as a wake up call in order to get us in the right direction and we proved we had great improvement with our third presentation.

                      <p>The third presentation was our biggest success thus far. There were alot of major improvements that were made. Firstly due to our lack of research we created a new survey and sent it out to alot more people this time gathering alot more information(once again more information you can find on my research page) and also we decided to conduct an interview with a Professional working at Rosoluut. And we also worked on card sorting and also redid the requirements.</p>

                      <p>But by far the most usefull part of our research was the interview with Ashley deckers. This interview proved to be really useful due to the sheer amount of feedback we recieved.The highlights of which were question 3 which was about his expirience with creating protfolio and the answer that the portfolios are a long process during which gathering feedback form the client and the users is crucial. And question 9 which was centered around what not to do. The answer to that question was not to copy other people but create a portfolio that feels unique and expresses the client to its fullest </p>

                      In conclusion, I believe our performance exceeded expectations. As mentioned earlier, the interview played a crucial role in gaining insights into how professionals approach projects like this.
