                  <p>In the first lecture for design we had a lesson on colors and how to use them correctly. We talked about things like primary, secondary and tertiary colors, as well as the color wheel, this lecture also introduced me to a terms like hue, tint, tone and shade. On top of that while coming up with my portfolio I delved into color schemes which led to a rabbit whole where I got my first taste of analo-gous and complimentary color schemes

                    <div class="textboxx">
                      <p>During the lecture we also played a game(https://color.method.ac) in order to practice and work a bit with colors. The point of the game is to match the right hues, saturation, complementary, analogous, triadic and tetradic colors.the score that I got you can see on the left.

                    <p>This lecture was one of the most fun ones I have ever had and it thought me a lot about what color compliments what and where to use them.

                  <h4 class="h41">Image<span> formating</span></h4>
                  <p>During this lectures we learned about image formatting and the different us-es for each image format. The main takeaway which I got was that when editing its best to use png instead of jpg since pngs save more of the data in the picture and once compressed the data is gone which makes the picture look pixelated.</p>
                  <p>We also talked a bit about video formats and we compared the different vid-eo formats in class in order to find out which one is the best for what purpose. And after the discussions we decided that AV1 and H.264 are the way to go.</p>

                  <p>Although I wasnt able to participate during this lecture I got some infor-mation of what they did during it.

                    <div class="textboxx">
                      <p>As a practice they had to create a logo for the group project which I have posted the picture of on the left. From the information I got they wanted to make a hammer striking and anvil in order to represent Hephaestus the old name of our team.

                      <p>The other task we had was creating a logo of our own that we needed to put in our portfolio  I had a few iterations which i  will go over in order:

                    <div class="textboxx">
                      <h5 class="subheading">iteration 1</h5>
                      <p>The first iteration you can see on the left. I decided to go with the lion in order to represent my Home country Bulgaria as the lion is the national symbol of it. The lion represent fearless-ness strength and freedom. These are all values that I hold in high regard. When it comes to the moto this was the first thing that popped up in my mind and alt-hough cheesy I liked it.

                      <h5 class="subheading">iteration 2</h5>
                      <p>The second iteration went a bit off the rails since i didnt think that the lion fit a project such as a portfolio so I went with the design you See on the right. This is a design I used to draw on my notebook back In school when I was bored. The reason behind me drawing it so much Is my mother had a necklace that had that design which represents calmness, balance, harmony and luck.

                      <h5 class="subheading">iteration 3</h5>
                      <p>As for my own logo, it went through several versions. The first iteration featured a lion, symbolizing Bulgaria, my home country, and embodying qualities like strength and freedom, which are important to me. The second iteration was inspired by a design I often doodled, representing calmness and balance, reminiscent of a necklace my mother had. The third iteration included the motto "Trust the process," meaningful from my basketball days as this was the moto of my favorite team the 76ers, symbolizing perseverance and growth.
                        After getting some feedback from jan It was suggested to me to use the logos on some sort of an item to show how they would look. The two logos i used were my main one for the portfolio and a secondary one which you can see both in your tab menu and on the image on the right.

                    <p>Making my first real logo for a fictional brand was an exciting journey. The transformation of this logo from its humble beginnings to its final form was fun to see. It is a reminder that with dedication and the right tools I can bring my visions to life.</p>

                  <h4 class="h41">Magazines<span> and layouts</span></h4>
                  <p>In my media production class, we had this cool lecture about designing posters and magazines. The main thing I learned is that picking the right fonts, styles, and organizing letters is super important in making a design look awesome. They also talked about using a grid layout for magazines, which basically means setting up a kind of framework to make sure everything in the magazine looks great and fits well. It's like having a plan to make sure every part of the magazine is used the best way it can be!</p>

                      <p>
                        We got to put our learning into action with a group assignment in class. The task was all about creating the basic structure for a magazine layout – you know, like where the pictures, text, headings, ads, and author names go. Even though we didn't have to worry about colors and styles, the assignment was trickier than I thought, but it was also really fun. We had to figure out how to arrange everything, like a puzzle, so it all fit together nicely. We even had to go back and fix some parts because the measurements didn't quite add up. It's not flawless, but it's a good start for making better layouts in the future. Plus, it showed me how important the structure is.

                    <p>This project taught me that design basics such as grids, hierarchy, whitespace, and alignment are crucial. They play a big part in making a magazine layout look organized and professional. Working on it, I learned about the careful balance needed to create a design that's both visually appealing and functional. These fundamentals act as the foundation for a well-structured magazine layout.</p>

                    Crafting my photobook portfolio turned out to be both rewarding and challenging. Ensuring aesthetically pleasing images and designing an engaging layout were crucial elements of the process. I opted to utilize the Adobe tool InDesign for its detailed editing capabilities. After careful consideration, I chose a grey theme to with white and black as complementary colors. Below you would be able to see a file with my pictures.

                  In my initial submission, there were issues with how I presented the photobook. I had chosen to use a PowerPoint format, which, upon reflection, was not a very professional choice. For this second submission, I dedicated more time and effort to enhance both the quality of the pictures and the overall photobook. I'm genuinely proud of the project I've created this time. This photobook showcases some of my favorite pictures taken over the past few weeks, and, in my opinion, represents a significant improvement from the first photobook I made.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Completing the photo book prompted me to reflect on the task, revealing that it provided more than just a chance to stroll and appreciate my surroundings. It also served as a means for me to express myself creatively through photography composition. Engaging in this project has granted me valuable insights into camera techniques and picture composition—skills that I believe will be instrumental in my future career. As someone who has always been fascinated by camera work in movies and short films, this experience has deepened my understanding and passion for this aspect of visual storytelling.

                    We can't skip talking about photos without bringing up Photoshop, one of the top-notch photo editing tools available right now. Photoshop has caught my attention for quite some time. Thanks to this program, I've been able to craft some of my most favourite images. You can check out all of them and more in my photobook.
