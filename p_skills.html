            <article>
                <p>Over the past few weeks, I've been doing a lot of research for both my group project and my portfolio. For our group project, my team and I created alot of interview questions to better understand what our client needs. From the responses, we discovered that mobile integration is essential for our client. Taking this into consideration, we decided to start with a desktop application and make it responsive after development. Additionally, we conducted a survey among artist students and teachers, receiving feedback that they primarily use laptops to browse artist websites. They also expressed a preference for a minimalist design, which we plan to propose to our client, Athina.

                    Regarding my portfolio, I had two friends navigate through it, and they liked the color scheme and the simplicity of the design with not too many pages, making it user-friendly. I also received feedback from all of my teachers. Metaxas pointed out some issues with the contact form, which I promptly addressed. Josh and Lin suggested changes to the outcomes section, and I plan to implement those changes before the next submission.

                <p>Regarding communication, I believe I'm performing quite well. I value staying informed and continuously aim for improvement, making feedback crucial to me. Understanding the frustration of being uninformed, I ensure that our group keeps our client updated on any progress and addresses any requirements we might have overlooked.
                    To guarantee this, my group and I crafted interview questions, conducted surveys, and created personas. Our goal for the upcoming project day is to present all the gathered information to our client and seek her input on the planned changes. We're committed to considering every requirement she proposes during this discussion.
