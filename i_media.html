                    During the first week we were introduced to UX design and our task was to find examples of good and bad design in order to do that we had to analyze dif-ferent aspects of the product we have chosen and see how they affect the user experience.

                    <figcaption class="textboxx">
                      <p>For an example of a good UX design I chose amazon. It being as big as it it is they for sure understand what good UX design is from the research I did on it I saw that different versions of the website have different layouts that cater to the chosen country, it’s population and their tendencies.
                         For example I saw on the Japanesse version that books are a main focus of the website catering to the country’s emphasis on book reading.

                        As an example for bad UX design I chose the Housing website Bvvonen. I have had personal experience with this site and the user experience is far from nicely done. To begin the website is targeted towards international student but the website is fully in dutch. Secondly there are features that are useless such as save preference which resets every time you enter the website. Lastly one of the most annoying things I had to deal with was the tedious logging in which in or-der to do you need to go through their lackluster navigation and then log in and if you want to look up houses you need to go through 3 submenus in order to do so.

                      <p> Week two was focused on prototyping. This topic has already been a big part of my education thus far, putting a lot of time and emphasis on it during the first semester. Since I already had the basic idea of how my website was sup-posed to look creating the figma was quite easy and didn’t take much time. The main design choices i made were the devision of the outcomes into 3 bigger sec-tions which in time I found out was a big mistake. 
                        The final prototype you can see below.

                      <p>I n week 10/11 we were introduced to axure which is a tool for prototypes and in my opinion I like it way more than figma since I can create more detailed prototypes although it takes a bit more time having way more options and fea-ture in the prototype makes it feel way more complete. The exercise that I had was creating an online shop. I had some difficulties with it at first like inplementing variables propperly in order to calculate and save the data of products that have been added to cart. And also got feedback on it which you can see on the picture on the right. </p>

                        As mentioned earlier, we explored Axure, a powerful tool for developing more intricate prototypes. While it may be a bit challenging to grasp initially, once I got the hang of it and, more importantly, understood how to navigate it, Axure proved to be significantly better than Figma in my perspective.

                        When we started working with Azure we had a few tasks to complete in class. Those ranged from simple login page to a bit more complicated creation of tabs using Dynamic panels. The dynamic panels especialy were quite difficult for me to understand at first but with the help of my teacher i got it done.

                        I was assigned the task of creating a prototype for an online shop. Throughout the process, I faced challenges, particularly with implementing the "add to cart" feature. Initially, dealing with variables presented a significant obstacle. However, I discovered a useful solution through a YouTube video linked below. I intend to share the entire prototype once it's completed. Unfortunately, there was a setback as the file got corrupted due to the program not closing properly.

                  <p>In our recent class, we learned about empathy maps, which I found really interesting. The main idea is to gather information from the person you're helping, based on an interview you have with them. An empathy map has four main parts:</p>
                  <p><strong>1: Do</strong> - What they have done in order to fix the problem or find more information about it</p>
                  <p><strong>2: Thinks</strong> - Based on the interviewer’s intuition. It involves whether the client thinks a solution is good or not, based on subconscious cues.</p>
                  <p><strong>3: Say</strong> - A quick summary of what the client mentioned during the interview.</p>
                  <p><strong>4: Feel</strong> - Similar to 'Thinks,' this is something for the interviewer to pick up based on how the client reacts to certain questions or solutions proposed by the interviewer.</p>

                  <p>In our recent lecture, we delved into the concept of competitor analysis. The key focus in competitor analysis is discerning the factors that make one website more preferable than others. For this week's assignment, we were tasked with conducting a competitor analysis on two selected websites. I opted to compare Athi-na's website, our client, with Milkovi, another artist's website.</p>
                  <h5 class="subheading">Milkovi</h5>
                  <figure class="imagecontainer">
                    <img src="img/Milkovi.png" alt="milkovi" class="image3">
                    <figcaption class="textboxx">
                      <p>
                        For my first website, I chose Milkovi. During my analysis, I observed the color scheme and noted that, similar to many other artist websites, it favored simple and minimalistic designs. Moving on to navigation, it was clear and lacked excessive submenus, providing a straightforward user experience. Lastly, I examined one of their creations, noticing the emphasis on simplicity and a direct approach. The content was concise, focusing on detailing the creation process and the tools used, rather than including unnecessary information.   
                      </p>
                      <a href="https://milkovi.com" target="_blank" class="btn">Milkovi Website</a>

                      <p>
                        For the second website, I focused on our client's website. One notable difference was that Milkovi had an eye-catching landing page that heightened user anticipation, while our client's website lacked a proper main page. Recognizing this, we decided to incorporate a captivating main page to enhance the overall project. Examining the navigation, our client's website seemed limited with only two sections—one for the artist and another for both art and research. However, when exploring one of her works, I encountered a challenge in distinguishing between her artistic creations and research. This led to pages with excessive text and others with none. In the former case, it might discourage users from reading, while in the latter, it may not provide enough information for fellow artists seeking to understand and recreate her work.

                        In our recent lecture, we delved into the importance of observing how users interact with a product for its improvement. For my observation, I chose to focus on how people check in and check out on the bus. I discovered that individuals without an OV chip card checked in using their credit card. However, during the check-out process, they inadvertently swiped their card again, resulting in double payment—a design flaw, in my opinion. You can find the original observation document below.

                        This week, we explored the importance of crafting a user scenario for creating a user-friendly website. My assigned task was to develop a user scenario for a website of my choice, and I selected the process of buying limited edition shoes from nike.com. The objective was to detail every aspect of the user's journey, including their preparation, the information they researched, and more. You can find the complete user scenario below.

                        In our subsequent lecture, we delved into journey mapping, which, to my understanding, is a visual representation of the user scenario, considering emotions. This proves valuable in identifying user frustrations while pursuing their goals. For this task, my partner Wit and I created a journey map for a user aiming to buy limited-time shoes from nike.com. We began this exercise with Wit, as we were divided into teams. Upon completion, we sought feedback from our teacher. The feedback highlighted the need for more detailed explanations of the entire process and emphasized the necessity of incorporating a graph depicting the emotions experienced by the user throughout the journey.

                          I've gained considerable experience with personas over my last two semesters at Fontys. Their primary purpose is to consolidate crucial information gathered from team surveys, presenting it in a clear and structured manner. For this particular project, my project group and I developed two personas, carefully considering the insights derived from our surveys.

                        This task is a great example of how structuring the data into easier to read and understand format can greatly increase the productivity of you and your team when it comes to understanding what features are necessary and what aren’t.

                          Information Architecture is a method used to organize information effectively for users, helping them understand where they are on a website, what to find there, and what to expect. Achieving this requires organizing information in a clear and structured manner. To practice this concept, we were divided into two groups. Each group had to create an information architecture for a chosen website. Subsequently, we exchanged these cards with a random person from the other group to reorganize. This exercise aimed to assess whether the website layout was confusing for users or not.

                          A heuristic evaluation is a method used to assess the usability and user-friendliness of a product, such as a website or application.During a heuristic evaluation, evaluators go through the product, considering aspects like navigation, layout, feedback, and overall user interface designThe goal of a heuristic evaluation is to uncover issues early in the design process, allowing for improvements to be made before the product reaches its users. It's a valuable method for ensuring that a product is intuitive, efficient, and provides a positive user experience. How we used this to finish the task you can read below.

                        <p>Usability testing is a method used to see the effectiveness and efficiency of a website by seeing  how real users interact with it. The primary goal is to identify any usability issues or challenges that users may face during their interaction with the product.</p>

                        As a team, we ran two tests with different users. In the first test, I interviewed a friend for A/B testing on the main color scheme, which was my part of the project. The results were clear – people liked the light blue scheme better than the original darker version with orange as a complementary color.The second method, a moderated usability test I conducted, aimed to see how easy it was for users to move around the website. This test revealed a flaw: our contact page sometimes crashes. We found out that this happens because we used an extension instead of PHP to connect the contact form to the client's email.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        For our second usability test, we opted for a first impressions test. This test focused on what immediately strikes a user when they first see the website, their initial perception of the website's purpose, and what elements leave the most significant impression on them during their first interaction.
