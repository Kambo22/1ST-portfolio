                  <p> In order to get the best understanding of what our target audience wants in order to have a great experience using our clients site we constructed 2 surveys.  </p>
                  
                  <h5 class="subheading">First survey</h5>

                    <figcaption class="textboxx">
                      <p>In our initial survey, we posed various questions to users, with a particular focus on their preferences regarding the accessibility of a mobile interface. Notably, the responses shed light on a significant trend: a majority of artists expressed a preference for accessing art websites on their smartphones. This revelation prompted us to deliberate on whether our emphasis should be on optimizing the mobile version of the site or maintaining a strong focus on the desktop version. For a visual representation of the responses, please refer to the image on the left.</p>
                      <p>That being said, the data collected has proven to be immensely valuable in forming a foundational understanding of the expectations placed upon us. To delve deeper into the insights from the initial survey, you can it by clicking the button below.</p>

                      <p>As mentioned earlier, due to the limited responses from the initial survey, we took the initiative to develop a second survey. I personally reached out to some of my former classmates who are currently studying graphic design, seeking to gather insights from fellow artists. Additionally, Thijs and Yoshua extended the survey to researchers within their network. On the left side, you can observe a snapshot of responses we received, particularly focusing on input related to color schemes and design preferences.</p>
                      <p>After compiling responses from over 30 participants in our second survey, I believe we now have a significantly improved understanding of what is needed of us. The survey you can see below </p>

                      <p>Once we collected all the information, the next step was to make something called a persona. Personas are crucial because they sum up the most important details from the surveys in a simple and easy-to-understand format.</p>
                      <p>I was in charge of creating the persona, and you can check it out on the right side. Initially, I included age, but after getting advice from our teacher Josh, I learned it wasn't necessary for our project. Other feedback mentioned there was too much information, so I fixed that by summarizing the key points. The updated persona is on the left.</p>

                      <p>The main challenge I faced during the first submission of my portfolio was time. I spent too much time making it visually appealing instead of explaining my process and development. As a result, I received grades that were not any where near my original expectations.

                      <h5 class="subheading">solution</h5>
                      <p>To address this issue, I decided to gather as much feedback as possible, and this time I am much more prepared. My aim for this submission is to excel in all outcomes, and by incorporating the feedback I received, I believe it's an achievable goal. In my professional identity section, I have provided more detailed explanations of the changes I made, how I implemented them, and the reasons behind these modifications.</p>

                        We have had 2 interviews with our client thus far and we are planning to holding another one via email on the 4th of december. The reasons for the interviews were to gather as much information about the requirments as possible.

                    <p>
                      During the last week before winter vacation, my group and I were given the task of creating prototypes. We divided the responsibilities, with me working on the mobile version and Thijs on the desktop version. To ensure I deliver the best mobile version, I revisited our previous work, researched survey responses, and referred to notes from our last interview with the client. The client suggested that adding an extra button for research is unnecessary since they are connected. I find this confusing for users and believe it disrupts the consistency of the pages, especially considering art pieces have minimal text while research projects require a lot more. To address this issue, I proposed adding a "details" button, but I acknowledge that it might not completely solve the problem of user confusion regarding the site's identityâ€”whether it's primarily focused on art or research.

                    <p>
                      The surveys were crucial for understanding what users wanted on the website, and one of the key answers is shown on the left. This guided our decision to have both a mobile and desktop version. This choice influenced my work in creating the mobile prototype, which was then used in implementing the client's website.
                      <br>
                      <br>

                    <figcaption class="textboxx">
                    <p>
                      Another important answer that significantly contributed to the prototype creation was about how users wanted to get in touch with the artist (in our case, Athina). The responses made it clear that people preferred either social media or a contact form. This insight guided the addition of the form in the prototype, as indicated by the answers on the right.

                      Before delving into more details about how we reached this stage, take a look at the final version of the website on the left. It incorporates both light and dark color schemes, addressing the duality of survey answers and client requirements. The site is fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on both phones and desktops, aligning with the preferences expressed in the survey responses.
                    </p>
                    <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/1ecqHOdl7HIQhJBRMcWWKY/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=zTRlHX6HetIJcWwQ-1" target="_blank" class="btn">Client website.</a>

                    <figcaption class="textboxx">
                   
                    <p>
                      Certainly, we encountered some challenges when deciding on the color schemes, mainly because our users were divided between a dark or a colorful scheme preference. To address this, I created two color schemes. The first one is a bright scheme using baby blue and light orange as main colors, with white and black as complementary colors. The second scheme is darker, incorporating grey and darker orange as main colors, and once again, black and white as complements. To cater to the diverse preferences of our users, we opted to implement both dark and light themes, allowing users to choose between the two color schemes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Below you can see some user test reports which also helped with finalizing the color schemes. Such as the users wanting a nav menu button color that would stand out more on the light blue background.
